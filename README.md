# ELN-Pricing-Challenge

This repository attempts to etermine the fair value of an equity-linked note (ELN).

Our valuation model is a Monte Carlo pricing method that can be simplified into three steps: generating Monte Carlo simulations to map the possible price paths of each underlying, calculating total payouts depending on price paths taken, and averaging those total payouts to derive a fair value. From our model, we calculated a fair value of $19,132.99.
